COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
I take the letter from my pocket and read it.

Son,

I learned about your plans from a family friend. Although I hope you don't mean to execute them, I am writing this letter. I will come back home as soon as I am able.

There is good life for you in Falling Rock, despite everything. The mountains may seem dull and remote to your young heart, but they are safe.

I am surprised by the brash move. From you, of all people. Remember your health. Stay home and continue your training. Don't follow your brother's footsteps. Don't make my my heart break for the third time.

- Father
