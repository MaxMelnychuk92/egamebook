HINT: The clearing in the forest of San Francisco where we were ambushed.

DESCRIPTION: $NONE

FIGHT_SITUATION:

WHERE: among the trees

GROUND_MATERIAL: {earth|dirt}

AFTER_MONSTERS_CLEARED:
My hands are shaking and I put them on the sides of my neck to stop the shudder. As a necromancer, I am used to death. The long, unmoving part of it, mostly. The lying in the earth. The peaceful, waiting death. 

But this, this was something different entirely. Fast. Violent. Messy. This was the wild and savage face of death that I have not seen before. My hands are still shaking.

// TODO: stand up if Tamara ended the fight down, and isn't hurt
[[IF c.isHurt(tamaraId)]]Tamara is sitting on the ground now and tending to her wounds. "I'll survive, [young sir]. But you might not." She winces, and looks at me.[[ELSE]]Tamara checks her gear and sheathes her sword. Then she looks at me.[[ENDIF]] "Come with me back to safety. I'll give you a discount for the way back."

_"Thanks for your service, Tamara. But I've come this far."_

Tamara nods, and leaves without ceremony. In a few moments, she disappears among the trees and the bushes.

"Sorry, Tamara." I kneel next to her and put her in the position of a proper warrior death, with back to the ground and arms crossed over the body.

I look into Tamara's undead eyes.

"I'm sorry."

She doesn't respond, so I nod, and tell her corpse to follow me.
