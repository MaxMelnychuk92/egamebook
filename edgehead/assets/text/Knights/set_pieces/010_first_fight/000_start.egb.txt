Here I am in the ancient ruins of San Francisco. After a month long journey, I have finally reached my destination. My brother is here, somewhere.

I am also a necromancer. I can raise the dead, although not very well yet.

// The IF ELSE statement in the following paragraph must build the outputWorld (instead of just using c.playerIsMale) because the custom event for 'player_is_male' was set earlier this action (it's not yet in originalWorld).
I am here with Tamara, the deserter. She is the sword of my little expedition. It is unwise for a young necromancer to be traveling on [[IF c.outputWorld.build().customHistory.query(name: 'player_is_male').hasHappened]]his[[ELSE]]her[[ENDIF]] own.

Tamara has just finished telling me, for the hundredth time, what a stupid idea it is for me to come here. I tell her there's nothing to be worried about. I tell her the tales about goblins and orcs in the woods of San Francisco are exaggerated.

Which, of course, is immediately refuted by what happens next.

![A ferocious goblin is stepping out of a bush, holding a sword](goblin.jpg)

A goblin, death-hunger in his eyes, steps out of hiding, directly in front of us. I look around to see if there's more but no. He is alone. What gives the predator such confidence?

* Run ((This is a goblin: a killing machine. No one would fault me for leaving a fight I may hardly win.))

    Tamara seems pleased with this course of action at first. But the agile goblin is faster in the overgrowth. [[IF c.playerHasWoodenFoot]]My wooden stump doesn't help.[[ENDIF]] A few heartbeats later, he's almost upon us.

    He slashes Tamara's leg and she goes down. There is no more running now. [[IF c.playerHasAsthma]]I wheeze and cough. The damn asthma.[[ENDIF]] But I am able to pick up a solid branch from the ground and I have the initiative now.

    [[CODE]]
    // Make Tamara fall and lose initiative.
    w.updateActorById(
        tamaraId,
        (b) => b
        ..pose = Pose.onGround
        ..initiative = 0
        ..inventory.add(tamarasDagger));
    // TODO: Add the cut to Tamara's anatomy
    // Make goblin also lose initiative.
    w.updateActorById(firstGoblinId, (b) => b.initiative = 10);
    // Give branch to player.
    w.updateActorById(playerId, (b) => b.inventory.equip(startBranch, a.anatomy));
    [[ENDCODE]]

    The goblin growls like a wolf, standing above Tamara. She's had time to draw her dented sword but not much else. The goblin <>

* Attack ((There is no way around this. The goblin is clearly set on fighting us. May as well seize initiative before more of them show up.))

    "I escape war only to be dragged into *this* mess?" Tamara says through gritted teeth. But she moves forward, pointing her dented sword at the goblin. With her off hand, she hands me her dagger. "You'll need it, [young sir]."

    [[CODE]]
    w.updateActorById(playerId, (b) => b.inventory.equip(tamarasDagger, a.anatomy));
    w.updateActorById(firstGoblinId, (b) => b.initiative = 0);
    [[ENDCODE]]

    The goblin is out of the brush and ready to fight. He's gnashing his teeth and growls like a wolf. He <>

* Wait ((It could be a trap. Or the goblin could decide we are more than he can chew. In either case, caution might save our necks.))

    Tamara nods. She points her dented sword at the goblin but doesn't move. "Take my dagger, [young sir]," she tells me and moves her hip a little, to indicate where it's strapped.

    * * Take the dagger.

        [[CODE]]
        w.updateActorById(playerId, (b) => b.inventory.equip(tamarasDagger, a.anatomy));
        [[ENDCODE]]

        I take the dagger and point it in the direction of the goblin. The hilt is thick, and the weapon feels heavy but balanced. Before I know it, the goblin attacks. As he runs towards us, he <>

    * * Take a rock from the ground instead.

        [[CODE]]
        w.updateActorById(tamaraId, (b) => b.inventory.add(tamarasDagger));
        w.updateActorById(playerId, (b) => b.inventory.equip(rockFromMeadow, a.anatomy));
        [[ENDCODE]]

        I pick up a moldy rock that lies right next to my {left|right} foot. It's hard and heavy in my palm. As soon as I straighten up, the goblin attacks. As he runs towards us, he <>

-

<> taps his thigh with the blunt side of a rusty sword, grinning.
