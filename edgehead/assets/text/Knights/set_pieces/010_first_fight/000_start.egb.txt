Here I am in the ancient ruins of San Francisco. After a month long journey, I have finally reached my destination. My brother is here, somewhere.

I am also a necromancer. Which might come in handy around here.

"This place is dangerous, [young sir]." This is Tamara, my hired guide. She's walking a few paces in front of me, trying to see through the fog and the wild forest that was once a major city. The air is damp and raw.

* "Dangerous? This place? What an insight!"

    Tamara gives me a look. "Extremely funny," she whispers.

    * * "It can't be more dangerous than the journey here."

        Then again, I _have_ seen <>

    * * "Sorry."

        Tamara shrugs, and starts walking again. I look around, at the thick overgrowth. I've seen <>

* "Do you see anything?"

    "No," she whispers. "Trees and leaves and fog. And corpses."

    It's true. I've also seen <>

* "I will keep my eyes open."

    Tamara nods. "Good," she whispers, and starts walking again. I look around, at the thick overgrowth. I've seen <>

-

<> quite a few corpses in the few hours we have been here. (All of them way too old and blood-dry to raise, though.)

Tamara stops. For a moment, she's as still as a painting, and I try to mirror her. Then, she nods in the direction of a brush just ahead. It's shaking. Then something, something evil and fierce, steps right out of it.

Keeping her teeth together, Tamara says: "I might need your help with this. Take my dagger."

// TODO: make this work - dagger / rock must be held

* "No. I'm not a warrior."

    [[CODE]]
    w.updateActorById(tamaraId, (b) => b.inventory.add(tamarasDagger));
    [[ENDCODE]]

    Tamara purses her lips but says nothing. Then, without warning, <>

* "Keep it. I'll improvise."

    [[CODE]]
    w.updateActorById(playerId, (b) => b.inventory.equip(rockFromMeadow, a.anatomy));
    w.updateActorById(tamaraId, (b) => b.inventory.add(tamarasDagger));
    [[ENDCODE]]

    I pick up a moldy rock that lies right next to my {left|right} foot. It's hard and heavy in my palm. As soon as I straighten up, <>

* "Thanks, I'll take it."

    [[CODE]]
    w.updateActorById(playerId, (b) => b.inventory.equip(tamarasDagger, a.anatomy));
    [[ENDCODE]]

    I take the dagger and point it in the direction of the goblin. The hilt is thick, and the weapon feels heavy but balanced. Before I know it, <>

-

<> the goblin is out of the brush and ready to attack. He's gnashing his teeth and growls like a wolf. He taps his thigh with the blunt side of a rusty sword.
