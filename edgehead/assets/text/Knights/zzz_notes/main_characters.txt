## Aren

An outsider coming from "Cannibal country", from the mountains. His country is called "Falling Rock". In those parts, Necromancy is forbidden. It's backwater, and relatively safer than San Francisco.

Contrast: sickly-looking person -- a powerful necromancer & swordsman

Internal conflict:

* Forgive brother? Sarn took off with family money to get away from Falling Rock and get a new life. It took Aren and his father years to get out of debts.
* Use powers for good? Will he become the next Big O? "There's something in me that envies Osiris, that wants to be in his place."
* Risk the broken heart of his own father if Aren dies? Father already lost one son, and a wife.


## Sarn (Aren's brother)

A virile blacksmith. A narrative "clone" for Aren (similar, but missing that one thing). His adventure went absolutely terrible. He wanted the adventure, but went without a real sense of meaning. Just "go with the flow", "carpe diem" type of guy.

This lead to him never really getting out of a "field blacksmith" role. Until he was captured during a raid, and now he is slaving for the other side.

Sarn did something that Aren hates him for.


## Big O (Osiris)

Wants to prevent another "Arrival" by being all knowing. The only way to do that: be immortal, or at the very least very long-lived. What are a few thousand dead against the chance that humanity survives the next apocalypse.
 
* "I don't care about how you feel about all this. Cattle can feel. Only a few can think."
* "I am impressed. I truly am. I don't think I had the gift as young as you do. I can spare you, and I ask you of only one thing in exchange. Use your head."

His name might be "William" or "Pereira" (after William Pereira, the architect of the Transamerica Pyramid).

Contrast: very noble looking and stoic -- actually vicious


## Oracle

Hippie lover of all things ancient. Nobody touches her because she is too valuable, and people are unsure whether or not she is a wizard (or worse, a tech-mancer). Pronounces tech like teχ in LaTeΧ (with guttural "kh").
 
* "Right on, this is, oh, exactly what I was talking about."
* "Dude, chill. This is intense, sure, but we won't solve this by being all freaked out."

Contrast: impractical wise person -- actually has a stash of weapons and a pretty decent plan of defense.


## Colonel Jinhua

- TODO: JOIN WITH Horseman White?

(Named after the daughter of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_Guiying.)

Main knight.

Torn between duty and rationality (keep Knights alive by retreating) and internal moral compass (honor, defending the helpless). If given the chance, will sacrifice herself.

Loves youth. Says she envies. But then, she often jumps into Aren's speech. (e.g. we let the player construct a sentence, and then before Aren finishes the first word, the Colonel says: "Let me finish, child.".)

* "My child, I wish I saw the world with your eyes, so simple and straightforward. Instead, I live in the complicated hell that is real life."
* "Die, goblin scum! This is for all the young ones that fell by your dirty swords."

Contrast: a sensible leader -- actually wants to die to achieve nirvana.


## Horseman White

The lord knight responsible for organizing the Knights' retreat from the Pyramid. Terrified of the place. Personally wants out of there as soon as possible. He doesn't really think about a legacy: survival trumps that.

* "I will not flee myself but I will gladly withdraw with the rest. And you, you should leave as soon as possible if you want to live."
* "No you don't. People think that but they don't, really. They don't owe each other nothing."

Contrast: high status -- low glory, no legacy


# Ada the farmer

A motherly figure. Raised a child and now the nest is empty. She has second thoughts about career vs children: she would have liked more than one. Had grown apart from the husband (maybe Jisad?).

* "Are you cold? You look like you are freezing. I have some clothes after Pascal. He's left. He won't be needing them."
* "I like this life. It's a good, comfortable life. I worked hard for it."

Contrast: supportive and warm and welcoming -- extremely sad


## Darg

An orc. Wants to please his horde. Literally crowdsourcing leadership. Does not go well because following the lowest common denominator is not leadership.

* "I'm just doing what the Crowd wants. Who am I to tell them anything else."


## Jisad (Blind Guide)

Hates magic and longs for the simpler times before the Pyramid was a focal point of so much power play. Wants his former life back. He wants his old Pyramid back, the way it was in a brittle equilibrium.

What does he want that clashes with Aren at the start? He wants the Tome of Necromancy to stay hidden, he wants to destroy it. He also hates violence and necromancy.

* "Ah, new blood. Well, welcome to the circus I guess."
* "I am blind, young sir, but I am not stupid. You come here for power, like everyone else. You forget there are people here who just want to live their lives."
* "I will do anything to make this place peaceful again. Just don't ask me to touch magic. Much less _black_ magic."

Contrast: blind old man -- actually bad ass.


## Leroy

The son of trader Joseph Siencyn.
 
The name Siencyn is a Welsh variant of "Jenkins" -- an allusion to Leeroy Jenkins.


## Miguel (the avid knight at the entrance)

Drank a bit too much of the cool aid. Likes to think he will be the one sacrificing himself in battle. This is his idea of a legacy. To die heroically.

* "There is no glory in defending this place from the _outside_ when all the action happens inside."
* "I don't care what you think, coward."

Contrast: a "bro", talks about glory -- actually terrified for the farmers


## Kat (Miguel's master-knight)

Kat is much less avid than Miguel. Just wants to provide strength where needed, doesn't want to fight if not necessary.

* ...

Contrast: serious, stoic, professional -- cries when alone


## Black Sven

A segmented being. Was an ordinary Farmer, with plans and all, when a quake segmented him.

He is powerful, but only inside his reach. He is trying to die. 

* "What a ridiculous thing. Being trapped in this infinity. My limbs are vibrations. My eyes are seasons. I have no mouth and I must scream."
* "I have tried to terminate. But I cannot. Or, rather, I don't know how. How does one kill himself when there is no artery to cut? When there is no heart to pierce? When there is no height to jump from?"
* "Look at me, Aren. I have powers beyond anyone's imagination. I can do whatever I want in this little playground of mine. Lift a steel beam, disintegrate a piece of concrete, move a chunk of the wall to Not-Place. Despite this, I am powerless. What does it matter to have useless powers, in a small immovable bubble like this one. I am a child forever trapped with an ant hill. All I can do is play."
* "This place, the Floating Point, is my playground, and my tomb."

Aren can help by killing Sven.

Contrast: superpowers -- powerless

Theme: If you scope down your sphere of influence, you can have huge powers. But it doesn't matter. Say, a videogamer can have huge influence on a videogame world -- not real impact. A kid can play with an ant hill -- no real impact.
