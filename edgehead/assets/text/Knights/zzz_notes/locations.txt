# "Filler" rooms

These are rooms that add more meat to the Upside. Otherwise, the upside would just be a few rooms, far from each other. But we want to give the player chance to make many decisions, and explore. Aren can always attack (gain coins, food).

* Kobolds talking (cruel)
* Orc playing cards with some goblins, and cheating (the goblins obviously know this, but don't say anything)
* Goblins training, and talking about how meaningless it is (they want actual blood)
* An empty corridor
* Someone big (Ettin?) eating a human leg
* Some goblin explaining to the other one the symbolism of 65 (2-4-8-16-32-64)

## Old ideas from [Pyramid](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xp0q903tnf099vvRsELrTfoxApN6KAUtWIU828r4cSY/edit) 

* The wizard's temple (at the very top)
* The orc commune
* Jungle (just a lot of wild animals, near a big hole in the outer wall)
* The Levator/Levitator shaft
* The cultists (they throw people down the shaft) to appease the gods
* The Blessed (they eat the people and animals that fall down the shaft)
* The bleeds - where different paths from the tower lead out of it.
* The mall - a market place that is relatively peaceful
* Farmers - they grow things on the outside walls and next to windows
* Bandits - human baddies
* The (ces)pool
* The reservoir
* A crashed Helicopter
