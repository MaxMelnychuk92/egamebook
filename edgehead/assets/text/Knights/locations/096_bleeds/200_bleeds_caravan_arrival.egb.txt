throw StateError("Player should have been to the Bleeds already.");
[[ENDCODE]]

VARIANT_UPDATE_DESCRIPTION:
The road that leads from the Pyramid entrance, between the buildings of the Bleeds, and into the forest of San Francisco, is full of wagons, bulls, and new people. A caravan has arrived. They're clearly not stopping for long. The bulls are still in their harnesses, the people are not sitting down, and there is nobody setting up tents.

There is some commotion around the trader's shop, not surprisingly. People are moving goods through the back. A tall figure is watching over all this. At first it seems like the person has a cape, but the truth is they don't. They are a taheen, and I know them. Gadelon, the hawk man. They traded in the Falling Rock.
