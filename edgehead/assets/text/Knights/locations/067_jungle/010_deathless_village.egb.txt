NOTES:

TODO: Make it harder to get here. Add at least one "twisty little passages" area in between jungle entrance and here. Or just "jungle floor", which is the place where you can meet lizard man

TODO: Village >> Observe - shows a bit more info, plus mentions a sarcofagus for a dead marine.

TODO: raising a well-preserved marine _and then putting him to rest_ should also trigger evDeathlessRespectGained

TODO: killing the lizardman when he's in the Jungle should also trigger evDeathlessRespectGained
