  There's a murmur among the onlookers of the tribe. "You seem to think I am your lesser because of my age and my height. That is not how the Deathless think. Now, please will you tell me

"There's only one thing the Deathless regret. The Lair of God was taken by the orcs long before I was born. They now use it as some kind of a prison, or a sty. Disgusting. But the temple had an artifact in it, a star made in the age of the ancients, and we think it's still there. That star means a lot to our people. Our Founder had it a hundred years ago, and it inspired her to bring the community to this place, to start the worship of the ancients, and to build the Lair of God."
