POS: 25, 48
MAP_NAME: Reservoir

FLAGS: $IDLE

DESCRIPTION:
A large, filthy pool in the middle of the building, covered with a layer of green sludge. The reservoir was clearly built by the ancients, with their straight lines and craftsmanship of the highest quality. There's an iron dam here.

// TODO: observe iron dam ("emergency hatch")

Everything is wet here, even the ceiling. Condensed water forms drops that land back on the water surface, making a hollow sound in the large room.

Something big just moved in the water.

// TODO: action: observe the water

Not that this makes the place any less gross.


// NOTES:
This place has a dam that leads to regular corridors.
It was build a long time ago by people with much more skill.
There is evidence that the orcs are using it.
