"Greetings. What's your business here?" The knight takes a second good look at me. "You look far from home."

* "I am far from home, yes."

  "Let me guess, a backwater place somewhere to the East?" He snickers. "No matter. Why are you here?"

  * * "I am searching for a Sarn of Falling Rock"

* "I am looking for my brother, Sarn of Falling Rock."

-

"Why would Sarn of Falling Rock be here, of all places? Any thinking man will go as far away from here as possible."

* "Yet you are here."

"I wouldn't be a very good Knight if I fled from my company, would I. But if you ask me... Wait." The knight shouts some commands at the servants, makes a short note in his book, and continues. "If you ask me, the withdrawal from here cannot come fast enough. I will not flee myself but I will gladly withdraw with the rest. And you, you should leave as soon as possible if you want to live."

-

* "I'm here to find my brother."

"How old is he? Cannot he take care of himself?"

-

* "Maybe he can't."

"So what? He's not your responsibility, kid. People think that but that's not how the world works. People don't owe each other nothing." He pauses. "Which brings me to the fact that <>

* "I am not here to care for him."

"A revenge, then?" He chuckles. "Amusing. Nevertheless, <>

-

<> I can't help you. I don't know anyone called Sarn. Or maybe I do but I don't remember. I am busy, as you can see."

* "What's your name."

"I am White. Horseman White."

-

* "I am Aren."

"Okay. I will probably not remember that."

Horseman White seems offended. "Why are you asking me this?"

"Not written by me, or any other Knight. <>

Horseman White smirks. "Well done, kid. You might yet have a future in leadership. <>

<> Doghead is a local myth. A creature with a dog's head and a human's body. He or she is supposed to come and save the day at some point. Just turns up and solves everyone's problems. It's magical thinking. Bullshit from centuries ago."
