// Note: This is the first time player is in the room (incl. parent), so we know they didn't kill the guards themselves.

Beyond the gate, a giant's carcass lies. Its belly is teared open from the inside, by a humanoid figure with a bird head. Two dead orcs lie next to a wall.

The gate is severly damaged. Through a crack, I can see a giant's carcass. Its belly is teared open from the inside, by a humanoid figure with a bird head.
