So, what are you trying to do?

* Find my brother
* Learn necromancy
* Achieve independence

-

That's not a goal. It's a waypoint. What are you trying to do?

* To be a better brother
* To be a better person
* To be better at what I do

-

That, again, is not a goal. It's a way to achieve something. What are you trying to do? What will 

*

"I love this city," she says, motioning towards the overgrown ruins outside the window.


"Aren't you bored of this talking? You're in San Francisco! People don't come to San Francisco to talk. People come here to slay."

You can play with some gadget and inadvertently fall down to a part of the jungle from here. You legs will get broken.
