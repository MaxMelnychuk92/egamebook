So, what are you trying to do?

* Find my brother
* Learn necromancy
* Achieve independence

-

That's not a goal. It's a waypoint. What are you trying to do?

* To be a better brother
* To be a better person
* To be better at what I do

That, again, is not a goal. It's a way to achieve something. What are you trying to do? What will
