APPROACH: $goblin_skirmish_patrol FROM $goblin_skirmish_main


// ---
ROOM: $goblin_skirmish_patrol

POS: 15, 97

FIRST_MAP_NAME: Smoke
FIRST_HINT: The smoke is black as death but the pillar is narrow. Looks like nothing more than a camp fire. Someone is not afraid to be found.

// This is not needed as of this writing, as we never re-visit. But we might change that in the future.
MAP_NAME: Ancient rubble
HINT: It's the place I met the goblin patrol.

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
There is no path in the direction of the smoke. [We] go through the brush and step over logs and ancient rubble.

When [we] come out of a particularly nasty shrub, I hear a short, guttural sound. I look up and see a lone goblin with a gray spear. The goblin is completely white â€” even his eyebrows are unpigmented.

"You lost, peasant?"

DESCRIPTION: $NONE
