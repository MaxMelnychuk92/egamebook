COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
The portrait depicts an aristocratic family. Handsome people.

A young, striking lady stands in the front. Kind of bored. It is clear the portrait was meant for her, as a memento for her later years. An inscription say "For our beloved Lady Hope".

NOTES:
// Vignette:
// Wooden floor in the Keep

Uneven after the years. But it does give the appearance of a castle, among the ancient flat walls. 

The sound is different, hollow.

The planks spring a little bit under my feet.

// TODO: I can look through the door and see Lady Hope. Show the picture.
