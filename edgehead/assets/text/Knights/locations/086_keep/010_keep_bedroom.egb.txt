COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
TODO: explain the family portrait

I take the family portrait. It's kind of unwieldy and awkward to hold, so I keep it in front of me, as a shield.

NOTES:
// Vignette:
// Wooden floor in the Keep

Uneven after the years. But it does give the appearance of a castle, among the ancient flat walls. 

The sound is different, hollow.

The planks spring a little bit under my feet.

// TODO: I can look through the door and see Lady Hope. Show the picture.
