The north skull

A device that the compass is pointing to. It's how you can find a hidden room (if using the compass in a room right next to it).

The skull room provides quick access to higher floors. You can also get there without the compass, but only from upward.

The skull is either immovable, or placing it somewhere will make goblins go there.
