FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
The plain, ancient geometry of the Pyramid's hallways is suddenly disrupted by a massive gate. The gate is from dark, richly ornamented redwood. 

This is a lord's house, except it doesn't stand on top of a hill or next to a lake. Instead, it is embedded in the ancient building.

The Keep

A part of the pyramid previously inhabited by aristocrats. These days, it's deserted. People are afraid of the ghost that dwells there. And lately, some people saw goblins.

There were some tomb raider there, snatching stuff. But the last party that was there came back decimated and insane.

The Keep is full of decrepit beauty. Rich people with taste lived there for fifty years.

There is the dining room, with a table of food that is as if people left in a hurry. Except it's clear that happened a decade ago. The dining room has a great overview of the surroundings. Lots of light. This is where Last Hope stands, watching.

There are the lord's quarters, which still has some coin. You can "rummage through" stuff. Maybe you get some information about the "house improvements" in the pyramid. There is some sense that money is a form of legacy. And money begets money, so it's a self perpetuating legacy. But money and convenience, in itself, is vanity. You have to use the money to have actual legacy.

There are also servants quarters, with evidence of goblins.
