![Illustration of Lady Hope, an undead woman with a katana.](hope.png)

Someone is talking through her. Impressive. She is clearly undead, and talking undead is something I've never even considered before. It is obviously necromancy of some higher level. TODO: the necromancer taunts me.

[[CODE]]
if (c.hasItem(familyPortraitId)) {
    s.add('Lady Hope seems taken aback by the portrait I have with me.', isRaw: true);

    w.updateActorById(
        ladyHopeId,
        (b) => b
          ..initiative = 0
          ..dexterity = b.dexterity ~/ 2);
}
[[ENDCODE]]

TODO: fight
// TODO: fight events when Lady Hope sees the portrait
// TODO: taunts from Big O

[[CODE]]
// This can be removed once we implement the fight. 
w.updateActorById(ladyHopeId, (b)=> b..inventory.remove(katana));
c.giveNewItemToPlayer(katana);
[[ENDCODE]]

I take the katana.

// TODO: post-fight description

Lady Hope is dead, but for a while, her head is still talking. Lady Hope's head: "I see you, young friend. I see your ambition. I see your talents. I see your brutality, which I like most of all. Too many young people limit themselves. Their effect on the world. You don't. But I warn you: you're not to cross me. You're not to ascend to the top. If you do, you die. You are not Doghead. It is not your fate to save this place. And that means, if you cross me, your fate is to die." And then, as if to illustrate the point, Lady Hope's face goes to rigor mortis, her features suddenly aging and wrinkling, and she talks no more.
