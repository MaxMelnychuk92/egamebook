// Keep this in sync with RaiseDead.helpMessage.
HINT: Raising the dead will make them fight for me. I do not know in advance which corpse will rise. I cannot do this if I am already followed by an undead. My powers are not strong enough to hold two unliving minds.

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
TODO: I perform necromancy. I feel I have awaken something human-sized but not entirely human. Then, terrible roar and thrashing comes from beyond the gate.

I perform the necromantic incantation but I fail. Nothing happens. [[IF isFollowedByAnUndead(c, a)]]My powers are not strong enough to hold two unliving minds, and I already have an undead follower.[[ENDIF]]
