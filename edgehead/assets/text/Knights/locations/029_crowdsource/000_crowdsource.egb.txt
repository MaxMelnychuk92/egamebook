ROOM: $crowdsource

POS: 27, 29
MAP_NAME: Crowd's Temple

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
A temple. Two orcs are talking. One of them is a shaman: an old but muscular female orc, with a long chain of human teeth around her neck, and a ceremonial dagger at her side. The shaman is addressing the other orc as Darg.

Darg is larger and considerably more muscular than the shaman. He is the leader of this orc outpost. A large battle axe made from ancient parts serves as both his weapon and his symbol of power.

[We] stay hidden.

DESCRIPTION: $NONE

FLAGS: $FIGHT_IS_OPTIONAL

FIGHT_SITUATION:
generateCrowdsourceFight

AFTER_MONSTERS_CLEARED:
I look around and there are no more orcs. The corridors are silent. I am fortunate that the temple is so secluded from the rest of the orcs' complex.

NOTES:
- This is where you finally confront the Akxe orc (named captain - Darg).
- Darg's head talks after you kill him. Big O is taunting you.
- Darg's Akxe is the key to the antechamber.
- You might see him before, but shouldn't be able to kill him.
