ROOM: $knights_hq_quake2

VARIANT_OF: $knights_hq_main

RULE: c.hasHappened(evQuake2) && !c.hasHappened(evCaravanDeparted)

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
I come to the headquarters. A large room overlooking the bay. Latrines on the right, hanging out of the window frames, providing fertilizer to the farmer slope below. To the left, as far from the latrines as possible, the bunks where a few of the knights sleep.

Miguel, the knight from the entrance, is here.

[[IF c.inRoomWith(leroyId)]]Leroy is here as well.[[ENDIF]]


VARIANT_UPDATE_DESCRIPTION:
Miguel, the knight from the entrance, is here.

// TODO: allow talking to Miguel
// TODO: for consecutive variants (like after caravan departure), also say something about Miguel so that it's not lost on the player that he's here if they don't visit the HQ just after quake 2.
