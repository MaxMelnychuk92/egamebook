NOTES:

Hawkman stands on top of the elevator shaft, looking out (using his hawk eyes). Talking to him will reveal the coming of the giants.

The reward of killing him:

* Some tantalizing info about what's happening: Big O is going to create a new civilization, on the shoulders of giants. "I can already see them." Said before the fight.
* The sickle is a cleaving weapon.
* Wearing the jacket will get worthiness.
