ACTION: $save_sarn
COMMAND: Jailer >> Attack

FOR_LOCATION: $smithy

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
TODO: fight. Assuming victory.

I take Sarn (and his hammer) through the Pyramid and outside, where he starts crying. I try to be mad at Sarn but instead I just take Sarn to Jisad and leave him there. He'll be safe at Jisad's.

As I leave the hut, I nod to both men, and Jisad, though blind, seems to notice the nod while Sarn doesn't.

I sigh and turn my back to them, and walk out to The Bleeds.
