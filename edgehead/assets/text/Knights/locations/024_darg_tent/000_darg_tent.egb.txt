FIRST_MAP_NAME: On Top of the Eastern Shaft
FIRST_HINT: There is access to the outside of the Pyramid here. The walls close to the ancient door are painted red and decorated with human teeth and other signs of orc power.

MAP_NAME: Orc Leader's Tent
HINT: A tent placed on top of the Eastern shaft, overlooking the bay.


FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
Tent outside, at the top of the elevator structure. Overlooking the bay. Some important orc must be stationed here.

DESCRIPTION: $NONE

FLAGS: $FIGHT_IS_OPTIONAL

FIGHT_SITUATION:
generateDargTentFight

AFTER_MONSTERS_CLEARED:
The fight is over. I look around and there are no more orcs. They probably didn't consider it necessary to post guards around this remote place.

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
Tent outside, at the top of the elevator structure. Overlooking the bay. Darg, the leader of the orcs I first saw in the orcs' temple, is here.

// No need to talk about Darg's weapon or appearance. If we see him here, that means we saw him in Crowdsource before.

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
[We] approach Darg's tent. Darg spots me and looks surprised at first, then amused.

"A human child, here?" Darg says, readying his battle axe. "Must have found a crawlspace to get here." He grins. "Never mind, [[IF c.playerIsMale]]boy[[ELSE]]girl[[ENDIF]]. I'll dance on your bones."
