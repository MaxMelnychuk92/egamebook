NOTES:
- This is empty unless you've heard Darg talk in the source.

- This is where you finally confront the Akxe orc (named captain - Darg).
- Darg's head talks after you kill him. Big O is taunting you.
- Darg's Akxe is the key to the antechamber.
- You might see him before, but shouldn't be able to kill him.
