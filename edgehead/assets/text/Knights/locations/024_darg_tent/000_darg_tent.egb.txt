TODO: After I defeat him, Darg's head starts to talk. There is no question that this is a necromancer talking through the newly deceased Darg. I am (once again?) impressed that a necromancer can be so precise at their craft. The necromancer discourages me from going to the very top of the Pyramid. "Last chance to turn around."

I take Darg's akxe.



NOTES:
- This is empty unless you've heard Darg talk in the source.

- This is where you finally confront the Akxe orc (named captain - Darg).
- Darg's head talks after you kill him. Big O is taunting you.
- Darg's Akxe is the key to the antechamber.
- You might see him before, but shouldn't be able to kill him.
