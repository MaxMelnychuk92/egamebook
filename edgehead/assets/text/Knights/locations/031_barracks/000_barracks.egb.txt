FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
A large room taking up two floors. Bunk beds, and a dining area. [We] stay hidden.

DESCRIPTION: $NONE

NOTES:

* What could we do here? 
  * See some vile creatures play a game, with the option to attack? Orc playing cards with some goblins, and cheating (the goblins obviously know this, but don't say anything)
  * Someone big (Ettin?) eating a human leg
