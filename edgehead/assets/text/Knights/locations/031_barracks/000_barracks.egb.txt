ROOM: $barracks

POS: 34, 31
MAP_NAME: Barracks

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
A large room taking up two floors. Bunk beds, and a dining area. [We] stay hidden.

I find a barbecued bat on a stool out of sight.


DESCRIPTION: $NONE

ACTION: $barracks_take_barbecued_bat
COMMAND: Barbecued bat
FOR_LOCATION: $barracks

INK:
The bat has been broiled well. Maybe too well. But there's enough meat on it.

c.giveNewItemToPlayer(barbecuedBat);

NOTES:

* What could we do here? 
  * See some vile creatures play a game, with the option to attack? Orc playing cards with some goblins, and cheating (the goblins obviously know this, but don't say anything)
  * Someone big (Ettin?) eating a human leg
