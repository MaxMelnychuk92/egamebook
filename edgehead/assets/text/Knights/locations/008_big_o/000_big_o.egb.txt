Soul is another word for inefficiency

Romance is another word for a lack of rationality

Empathy is another word for not minding your own business.

These are just words that let us feel good about our failings. I'm not interested in feelings.

I am interested in results.

The big O says this.


--- Doghead arc

# Ending arch

Someone: Doghead can't come soon enough, I say.

Someone: If the Doghead tale is true, then all of this doesn't matter. Doghead will come and save us all.

Someone: I believe in Doghead.

Writing on the wall: DOGHEAD

A small altar to Doghead.

Lady Hope's head: "I see you, young friend. I see your ambition. I see your talents. I see your brutality, which I like most of all. Too many young people limit themselves. Their effect on the world. You don't. But I warn you: you're not to cross me. You're not to ascend to the top. If you do, you die. You are not Doghead. It is not your fate to save this place. And that means, if you cross me, your fate is to die." And then, as if to illustrate the point, Lady Hope's face goes to rigor mortis, her features suddenly aging and wrinkling, and she talks no more.
