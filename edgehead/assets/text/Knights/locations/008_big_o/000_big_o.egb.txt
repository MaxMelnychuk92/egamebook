![Illustration of Big O, a necromancer with a dog's head.](bigo.png)

TODO: during a pre-fight dialogue sequence, we find out Big O is actually a human with a dog head. He's a necromancer who has lived hundreds of years, and he seeded the "Doghead will save us" myth generations ago, as an escape hatch. His ultimate goal was to prevent another apocalypse by instituting strict order, amassing power, and knowledge. Humanity cannot lose knowledge if it's in the mind of an immortal. The quakes were a way to attract mountain giants. The Orcs and goblins were brought on the myth of Doghead, and the promise of power over the other races.

* Test A
* Test B

-

// TODO: Big O reveals his name ("Osiris"), player has choice to call him that (renames BigO's entity) or ignore that, or even degrade him ("I will call you fucker instead.")

// TODO: big O notices asthma / wooden foot

The fight begins.

FIRST_MAP_NAME: The very top

// Vignette

Soul is another word for inefficiency

Romance is another word for a lack of rationality

Empathy is another word for not minding your own business.

These are just words that let us feel good about our failings. I'm not interested in feelings.

I am interested in results.

The big O says this.


--- Doghead arc

# Ending arch

Someone: Doghead can't come soon enough, I say.

Someone: If the Doghead tale is true, then all of this doesn't matter. Doghead will come and save us all.

Someone: I believe in Doghead.

Writing on the wall: DOGHEAD

A small altar to Doghead.
