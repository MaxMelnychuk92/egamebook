Soul is another word for inefficiency

Romance is another word for a lack of rationality

Empathy is another word for not minding your own business.

These are just words that let us feel good about our failings. I'm not interested in feelings.

I am interested in results.

The big O says this.

Someone: Doghead can't come soon enough, I say.

Someone: If the Doghead tale is true, then all of this doesn't matter. Doghead will come and save us all.

Someone: I believe in Doghead.

Writing on the wall: DOGHEAD

A small altar to Doghead.
