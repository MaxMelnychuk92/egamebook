APPROACH: $__END_OF_ROAM__ FROM $big_o_observatory
COMMAND: Descend
DESCRIPTION: 
I have prevailed.

TODO: an end, in which Aren (the player) shows the Dog's head to the people. Most of the Orcs and goblins flee. Aren is revered. A darkness is lifted from Sarn's mind, and he is no longer insane. He explains his past mistakes, and apologizes.

The end.


NOTES:

* But what was Conet for? What were these quakes for? ... In the distance, large figures are approaching. -- this is cool, but it could be seen as a cheap trick - an obvious cliffhanger. Instead, focus on making the ending deliver, emotionally.
