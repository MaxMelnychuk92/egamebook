INK:
I have prevailed.

// TODO: Use INK here and let the player explore the observatory, descend to the people, show the head, and make some stately decision (keep the Knights, or start a new kingdom, or...) as well as some personal decision (call on father, start from scratch, or ...).

TODO: an end, in which Aren (the player) shows the Dog's head to the people. Most of the Orcs and goblins flee. Aren is revered. A darkness is lifted from Sarn's mind, and he is no longer insane. He explains his past mistakes, and apologizes.

* A option
* B option

-

The end.
