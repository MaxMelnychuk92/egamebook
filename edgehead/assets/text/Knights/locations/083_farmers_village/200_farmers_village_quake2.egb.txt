ROOM: $farmers_village_quake2

VARIANT_OF: $farmers_village

RULE: c.hasHappened(evQuake2) && !c.hasHappened(evCaravanDeparted)

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
The corridors here look more like streets. Painted walls on either side, with wooden windows in them, and doors. Well dressed people run around, trying to repair the damage of the quake, repairing doors, cleaning debris. Yet others seem to ignore all that, instead focusing on packing.

The farmers are in full panic. Someone's crying about a person on the Slopes. 

Among all this, an old woman is whittling a little dog-headed figure from wood. She looks familiar.
