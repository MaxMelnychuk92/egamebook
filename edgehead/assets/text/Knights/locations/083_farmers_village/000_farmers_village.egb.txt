ROOM: $farmers_village

FLAGS: $IDLE

POS: 35, 83
MAP_NAME: Farmers' village
HINT: A settlement of people who farm the vines that grow on the outside of the Pyramid.

FIRST_MAP_NAME: A settled area
FIRST_HINT: From the outside, this part of the Pyramid is covered with vines, and there are clear signs of settlement in the windows.

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
The corridors here look more like streets. Painted walls on either side, with wooden windows in them, and doors. Well dressed people go about their business. Polite nods in my direction.

An old woman is whittling a little dog-headed figure from wood. She looks familiar.
