FOR_LOCATION: $conet

COMMAND: Kobold >> Attack

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
[We] step out of hiding. The kobold stops turning the wheel, briefly surprised. But then he jumps to the side and picks a big black wrench from a brown bag on the floor.

"Oh, this is going to be good," he says. "A human child."

ACTION: $conet_kobold_examine
FOR_LOCATION: $conet

PREREQUISITES:
!w.actionHasBeenPerformed('conet_attack')

COMMAND: Kobold >> Examine

INK:
The kobold is talking to himself as he's turning the wheel.

"How I wish I could be down there and fight," he says. "What I'd give to be able to crack some skulls."

He swings his free hand as if holding a weapon. "You talkin' to me?" he says to an imaginary foe. "You talkin' to me? Who the hell do you think you're talking to?"

Another swing of hand, and a grin.



NOTES:
- Name inspired by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conet_Project.
- Attracting "evil" / giants from far away.
- This is on the 32nd floor (binary symbolism).
- rejected: one of the kobolds is actually undead. He talks to me during the fight and after I kill him. It is obvious that the talking is done remotely, by some necromancer with amazing skill. The necromancer is discouraging me from getting involved.
