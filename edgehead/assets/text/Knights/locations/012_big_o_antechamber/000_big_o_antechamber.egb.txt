ROOM: $big_o_antechamber
MAP_NAME: Antechamber

POS: 26, 12

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
A dark room without windows. A stone staircase leads up to a trap door in the ceiling.

A curious lock mechanism guards the trap door from being opened.

DESCRIPTION: $NONE


// ---
ACTION: $examine_antechamber_lock
COMMAND: lock mechanism >> examine
FOR_LOCATION: $big_o_antechamber

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
It is a long slit with an irregular shape. If it's meant to be opened by a key, the key must be massive, and weirdly shaped.

// Maybe implement this as an INK, with "interrogation" of the lock.

[[IF c.hasItem(akxeId)]]After a few moments, I realize the shape of the lock reminds me of something ancient. I look at the akxe and its hilt. It will fit.[[ENDIF]]


// ---
ACTION: $open_antechamber_lock
COMMAND: lock mechanism >> open with akxe
FOR_LOCATION: $big_o_antechamber

PREREQUISITES:
w.actionHasBeenPerformed('examine_antechamber_lock')
&&
c.hasItem(akxeId)

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
I insert the hilt of Darg's akxe to the lock mechanism. It fits perfectly. Something in the trapdoor clicks, and it slowly opens.
