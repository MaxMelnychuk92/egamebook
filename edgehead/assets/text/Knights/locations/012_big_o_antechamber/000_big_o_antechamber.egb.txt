ROOM: $big_o_antechamber
MAP_NAME: Antechamber

POS: 26, 12

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
A dark room without windows. A stone staircase leads up to a trap door in the ceiling.

A curious lock mechanism guards the trap door from being opened.

DESCRIPTION: $NONE

ACTION: $examine_antechamber_lock
COMMAND: lock mechanism >> examine
FOR_LOCATION: $big_o_antechamber

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
The mechanism is complex and delicate. Not quite ancient but definitely a work of someone skillful.

In contrast to the intricate texture of the bulk of the mechanism, the center of the lock is simple. An elegant circle, about the size of my palm. This must be the equivalent of a key slit.

[[IF c.hasItem(theNullId)]]After a few moments, I realize the shape of the lock reminds me of something I have. The circular badge of the orc leader. It will fit.[[ENDIF]]

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
I climb up the ladder and place the metal circle in the center of the mechanism. It fits perfectly. Something in the trapdoor clicks, and it slowly opens, as if held by an invisible hand.

The ladder leads upwards, through a dark shaft and into a sun-lit space far above.
